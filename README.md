# XAFCodeGenCustomLocalization

This tool should help with creating type safe localization for XAF
In XAF (DevExpress) you have to work with "CaptionHelper.GetLocalizedText" method, if you want to receive localized strings
The DevExpress documentation for this: https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112655/localization/how-to-localize-custom-string-constants

I have a lot of custom localized text and I don't want to write the method every time.
This is the reason of this tool.

It generates a complete useable class with all the localization text you entered.

Everybody is welcome this tool for free (MIT License)
